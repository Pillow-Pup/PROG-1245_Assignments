            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <!--Parargraph taken straight from Wikipedia, with a couple tweaks-->
            <p>Maurits Cornelis Escher <i>(17 June 1898 â€“ 27 March 1972)</i> was a Dutch graphic artist who made woodcuts, lithographs, and mezzotints, many of which were <b>inspired by mathematics</b>. 
                Despite wide popular interest, Escher was neglected in the art world for most of his life, even in his native homeland of The Netherlands. 
                He was 70 years old before a retrospective exhibition was held. 
                In the late twentieth century, he became more widely appreciated, and in the twenty-first century, he has been <b>celebrated in exhibitions around the world</b>.</p>
